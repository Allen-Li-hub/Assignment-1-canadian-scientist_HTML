      Berners-Lee was born on June 8, 1955 in London, England, the eldest of
      four children of Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee; his brother Mike
      is a professor of ecology and climate change management. His parents were
      computer scientists who worked on developing the first commercially
      manufactured computer, the Ferranti Mark 1. He attended Sheen Mount
      Primary School and then went on to attend Emanuel School in South West
      London from 1969 to 1973, then a direct funded grammar school, which
      became an independent school in 1975. An avid train watcher as a child, he
      learned electronics by tinkering with model railways. He studied at
      Queen's College, Oxford University from 1973 to 1976, where he obtained a
      first class BA in Physics. During college, Berners-Lee built a computer
      out of an old TV, which he bought from a repair shop.
